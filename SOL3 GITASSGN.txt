Ques3: Explain what .gitignore is and why its important in version control.

Sol:
A .gitignore file is a text file in a Git repository that tells Git which files or directories
to ignore and not track. This is particularly useful in managing files that should not be 
version-controlled, such as temporary files, configuration files with sensitive information,
and files generated during build or runtime.

Importance in Version control:
1. Avoid cluttering the repository.
2. Prevent Unnecessary File Tracking:
3. Security and privacy
4.Reduce conflicts
