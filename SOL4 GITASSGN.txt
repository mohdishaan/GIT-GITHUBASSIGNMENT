Ques4 : Briefly explain what Github is and how it facilitates collaberation and version control and also name some alternatives to Github.

Sol: 
GitHub is a web-based platform built on top of Git, a distributed version control system.
It provides hosting for Git repositories, enabling developers to manage and collaborate on 
projects, track changes, and control versions of their code. It is widely used for both
open-source and private projects.

Github facilitates collaberation and version control by providing a centralized location (remote repository) where all contributors can push their changes.
By leveraging Git, GitHub tracks every change made to a project, allowing developers to:
1. Roll back to previous versions.
2. See who made changes and why.
3. Merge different changes into a single version.
Developers can create branches to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.
GitHub provides a pull request feature, where developers can propose changes. Team members can review these changes, discuss them, and merge them into the main codebase if approved.
