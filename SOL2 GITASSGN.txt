Ques2: Explain the Git Workflow, including the staging area, working directory and repository.

Sol:
The Git workflow involves several key concepts that help manage and track changes in a project. Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers collaborate on code, manage changes, and maintain a history of the project.  

1. Working directory:
This is where your project files lives on your local machine. It's essentially the folder that contains the code you're working on.
When you make changes to files like edit, delete, or add new files, you're modifying files in the working directory.

2. Staging Area:
The staging area is a middle ground between the working directory and the repository.
Before committing changes to the repository, you must first stage them. This means selecting specific files or parts of files that you want to include in your next commit.

3. Repository:
The repository is the place where Git stores all the changes and the history of the project.
When changes in the staging area are committed, they are stored in the repository with a unique ID, along with a message that explains the changes.
